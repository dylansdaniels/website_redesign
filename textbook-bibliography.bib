	abstract = {Neuromagnetic signals of guinea pig hippocampal slices were characterized and compared with the extracellular field potential to elucidate the genesis of magnetoencephalographic signals in a mammalian CNS structure. The spatial distribution of magnetic evoked field (MEF) directed normal to bath surface was similar for transverse CA1, longitudinal CA1 and longitudinal CA3 slices in the presence of 0.1 mM picrotoxin (PTX) which blocks inhibitory synaptic transmission. Their MEFs were produced by currents along the longitudinal axis of the pyramidal cells. Comparisons of the MEF with the laminar potential profile revealed that the MEF was generated by intracellular longitudinal currents. The dipolar component of the intracellular currents was the dominant factor generating the MEF even at a distance of 2 mm from the slice. The MEF from a slice in Ringer's solution without PTX became similar in temporal waveform with time to the MEF in the presence of PTX, indicating the predominance of excitatory connections in generating the MEF and the existence of highly synchronous population activities across the slice even in PTX-free Ringer's solution. The presence of such highly synchronous population activities underlying the MEFs was verified directly with field potentials recorded across the slice. A systematic variation of the stimulation site revealed a characteristic waveform for each site. The variation of the waveform with stimulation site suggested the contribution of many factors, both synaptic and voltage-sensitive conductances, to the overall waveform of the MEF.},

	abstract = {Variations in cortical oscillations in the alpha (7–14 Hz) and beta (15–29 Hz) range have been correlated with attention, working memory, and stimulus detection. The mu rhythm recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a prominent oscillation generated by Rolandic cortex containing alpha and beta bands. Despite its prominence, the neural mechanisms regulating mu are unknown. We characterized the ongoing MEG mu rhythm from a localized source in the finger representation of primary somatosensory (SI) cortex. Subjects showed variation in the relative expression of mu-alpha or mu-beta, which were nonoverlapping for roughly 50\% of their respective durations on single trials. To delineate the origins of this rhythm, a biophysically principled computational neural model of SI was developed, with distinct laminae, inhibitory and excitatory neurons, and feedforward (FF, representative of lemniscal thalamic drive) and feedback (FB, representative of higher-order cortical drive or input from nonlemniscal thalamic nuclei) inputs defined by the laminar location of their postsynaptic effects. The mu-alpha component was accurately modeled by rhythmic FF input at approximately 10-Hz. The mu-beta component was accurately modeled by the addition of approximately 10-Hz FB input that was nearly synchronous with the FF input. The relative dominance of these two frequencies depended on the delay between FF and FB drives, their relative input strengths, and stochastic changes in these variables. The model also reproduced key features of the impact of high prestimulus mu power on peaks in SI-evoked activity. For stimuli presented during high mu power, the model predicted enhancement in an initial evoked peak and decreased subsequent deflections. In agreement, the MEG-evoked responses showed an enhanced initial peak and a trend to smaller subsequent peaks. These data provide new information on the dynamics of the mu rhythm in humans and the model provides a novel mechanistic interpretation of this rhythm and its functional significance.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The (8–12 Hz) neocortical alpha rhythm is associated with shifts in attention across sensory systems, and is thought to represent a sensory gating mechanism for the inhibitory control of cortical processing. The present preliminary study sought to explore whether alpha frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) could modulate endogenous alpha power in the somatosensory system, and whether the hypothesized modulation would causally impact perception of tactile stimuli at perceptual threshold. We combined electroencephalography (EEG) with simultaneous brief and intermittent tACS applied over primary somatosensory cortex at individuals’ endogenous alpha frequency during a tactile detection task ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 12 for EEG, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 20 for behavior). EEG-measured pre-stimulus alpha power was higher on non-perceived than perceived trials, and analogous perceptual correlates emerged in early components of the tactile evoked response. Further, baseline normalized tactile detection performance was significantly lower during alpha than sham tACS, but the effect did not last into the post-tACS time period. Pre- to post-tACS changes in alpha power were linearly dependent upon baseline state, such that alpha power tended to increase when pre-tACS alpha power was low, and decrease when it was high. However, these observations were comparable in both groups, and not associated with evidence of tACS-induced alpha power modulation. Nevertheless, the tactile stimulus evoked response potential (ERP) revealed a potentially lasting impact of alpha tACS on circuit dynamics. The post-tACS ERP was marked by the emergence of a prominent peak ∼70 ms post-stimulus, which was not discernible post-sham, or in either pre-stimulation condition. Computational neural modeling designed to simulate macroscale EEG signals supported the hypothesis that the emergence of this peak could reflect synaptic plasticity mechanisms induced by tACS. The primary lesson learned in this study, which commanded a small sample size, was that while our experimental paradigm provided some evidence of an influence of tACS on behavior and circuit dynamics, it was not sufficient to induce observable causal effects of tACS on EEG-measured alpha oscillations. We discuss limitations and suggest improvements that may help further delineate a causal influence of tACS on cortical dynamics and perception in future studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Gamma frequency rhythms have been implicated in numerous studies for their role in healthy and abnormal brain function. The frequency band has been described to encompass as broad a range as 30–150 Hz. Crucial to understanding the role of gamma in brain function is an identification of the underlying neural mechanisms, which is particularly difficult in the absence of invasive recordings in macroscopic human signals such as those from magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Here, we studied features of current dipole (CD) signals from two distinct mechanisms of gamma generation, using a computational model of a laminar cortical circuit designed specifically to simulate CDs in a biophysically principled manner (Jones et al., {\textless}xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47"{\textgreater}2007{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}, {\textless}xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"{\textgreater}2009{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}). We simulated spiking pyramidal interneuronal gamma (PING) whose period is regulated by the decay time constant of GABA$_{\textrm{A}}$-mediated synaptic inhibition and also subthreshold gamma driven by gamma-periodic exogenous excitatory synaptic drive. Our model predicts distinguishable CD features created by spiking PING compared to subthreshold driven gamma that can help to disambiguate mechanisms of gamma oscillations in human signals. We found that gamma rhythms in neocortical layer 5 can obscure a simultaneous, independent gamma in layer 2/3. Further, we arrived at a novel interpretation of the origin of high gamma frequency rhythms (100–150 Hz), showing that they emerged from a specific temporal feature of CDs associated with single cycles of PING activity and did not reflect a separate rhythmic process. Last we show that the emergence of observable subthreshold gamma required highly coherent exogenous drive. Our results are the first to demonstrate features of gamma oscillations in human current source signals that distinguish cellular and circuit level mechanisms of these rhythms and may help to guide understanding of their functional role.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we used the biophysical modelling software Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN) whose foundation is a canonical neocortical circuit model to interpret the cell and network mechanisms contributing to macroscale AEFs elicited by a simple tone, measured with magnetoencephalography. We found that AEFs can be reproduced by activating the neocortical circuit through a layer specific sequence of feedforward and feedback excitatory synaptic drives, similar to prior simulation of somatosensory evoked responses, supporting the notion that basic structures and activation patterns are preserved across sensory regions. We also applied the modeling framework to develop and test predictions on neural mechanisms underlying AEF differences in the left and right hemispheres, as well as in hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to the presentation of the auditory stimulus. We found that increasing the strength of the excitatory synaptic cortical feedback inputs to supragranular layers simulates the commonly observed right hemisphere dominance, while decreasing the input latencies and simultaneously increasing the number of cells contributing to the signal accounted for the contralateral dominance. These results provide a direct link between human data and prior animal studies and lay the foundation for future translational research examining the mechanisms underlying alteration in this fundamental biomarker of auditory processing in healthy cognition and neuropathology.},

Here, we attempt to reconcile models operating at the microscopic (compartmental) and mesoscopic (neural mass) scales to analyse data from microelectrode recordings of intralaminar neural activity. Although these two classes of models operate at different scales, it is relatively straightforward to create neural mass models of ensemble activity that are equipped with priors obtained after fitting data generated by detailed microscopic models. This provides generative (forward) models of measured neuronal responses that retain construct validity in relation to compartmental models. We illustrate our approach using cross spectral responses obtained from V1 during a visual perception paradigm that involved optogenetic manipulation of the basal forebrain. We find that the resulting neural mass model can distinguish between activity in distinct cortical layers – both with and without optogenetic activation – and that cholinergic input appears to enhance (disinhibit) superficial layer activity relative to deep layers. This is particularly interesting from the perspective of predictive coding, where neuromodulators are thought to boost prediction errors that ascend the cortical hierarchy.},

	abstract = {Motor cortical activity in the beta frequency range is one of the strongest and most studied movement-related neural signals. At the single trial level, beta band activity is often characterized by transient, high amplitude, bursting events rather than slowly modulating oscillations. The timing of these bursting events is tightly linked to behavior, suggesting a more dynamic functional role for beta activity than previously believed. However, the neural mechanisms underlying beta bursts in sensorimotor circuits are poorly understood. To address this, we here leverage and extend recent developments in high precision MEG for temporally resolved laminar analysis of burst activity, combined with a neocortical circuit model that simulates the biophysical generators of the electrical currents which drive beta bursts. This approach pinpoints the generation of beta bursts in human motor cortex to distinct excitatory synaptic inputs to deep and superficial cortical layers, which drive current flow in opposite directions. These laminar dynamics of beta bursts in motor cortex align with prior invasive animal recordings within the somatosensory cortex, and suggest a conserved mechanism for somatosensory and motor cortical beta bursts. More generally, we demonstrate the ability for uncovering the laminar dynamics of event-related neural signals in human non-invasive recordings. This provides important constraints to theories about the functional role of burst activity for movement control in health and disease, and crucial links between macro-scale phenomena measured in humans and micro-circuit activity recorded from animal models.},

This study employed multiple-electrode arrays with relatively high spatial resolution (0.1 or 0.2 mm spacing) to record laminar profiles of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs), multiple unit activity (MUA) and current source-densities (CSDs) at several sites across the postcentral gyri of two awake monkeys. This high resolution laminar analysis strongly supports our earlier hypothesis based upon low resolution data that N1 is generated by synaptic excitation targeted specifically at the most superficial cortical layers I/II: (1) The excitatory nature of N1 was indicated by elevated MUA which was maximal in layer III and extended down to subcortical white matter where fiber activity exceeded prestimulus levels; (2) In addition to CSD analysis, the observation that N1 was maximally negative within 0.10 mm of the border between layers I and II verified the superficial site of N1 synaptic excitation regardless of conductivity boundaries near the pial surface. A review of the anatomical literature finds that the most likely inputs responsible for N1 activation are the “backward” cortico-cortical projections from secondary somatosensory areas to SI which in area 1 are the major source of sensory-related input that specifically terminates in layers I/II. We suggest, therefore, that backward projections are involved in the conscious process of touch sensation as it is signaled by N1.},

	abstract = {Rhythms are a prominent signature of brain activity. Their expression is correlated with numerous examples of healthy information processing and their fluctuations are a marker of disease states. Yet, their causal or epiphenomenal role in brain function is still highly debated. We review recent studies showing brain rhythms are not always ‘rhythmic’, by which we mean representative of repeated cycles of activity. Rather, high power and continuous rhythms in averaged signals can represent brief transient events on single trials whose density accumulates in the average. We also review evidence showing time-domain signals with vastly different waveforms can exhibit identical spectral-domain frequency and power. Further, non-oscillatory waveform feature can create spurious high spectral power. Knowledge of these possibilities is essential when interpreting rhythms and is easily missed without considering pre-processed data. Lastly, we discuss how these findings suggest new directions to pursue in our quest to discover the mechanism and meaning of brain rhythms.},

In some nuclei, a core of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons is superimposed upon the matrix. Core neurons project in a topographically ordered fashion to middle layers of the cortex in an area-specific manner. Matrix neurons, recruited by corticothalamic connections, can disperse activity across cortical areas and thalamic nuclei.

This activity consists of 3 main components: the classic occipital α rhythm, the Rolandic μ rhythm, and the so-called third rhythm. In recent years, the long-held belief that α rhythms are strongly influenced by the thalamus has been confirmed in several animal models and, in humans, is well supported by numerous noninvasive imaging studies. Of specific importance is the emergence of 2 key cellular thalamic mechanisms, which come together to generate locally synchronized α activity. First, a novel form of rhythmic burst firing, termed high-threshold (HT) bursting, which occurs in a specialized subset of thalamocortical (TC) neurons, and second, the interconnection of this subset via gap junctions (GJs). Because repetitive HT bursting in TC neurons occurs in the range of 2 to13 Hz, with the precise frequency increasing with increasing depolarization, the same cellular components that underlie thalamic α rhythms can also lead to θ (2-7 Hz) rhythms when the TC neuron population is less depolarized. As such, this scenario can explain both the deceleration of α rhythms that takes place during early sleep and the chronic slowing that characterizes a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

Little is known, however, about the activation of these pathways at the level of the local neocortical microcircuit. We report a disynaptic inhibitory pathway among neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs). Inhibitory responses were evoked in layer 5 PCs following stimulation of individual neighboring PCs with trains of action potentials. The probability for inhibition between PCs was more than twice that of direct excitation, and inhibitory responses increased as a function of rate and duration of presynaptic discharge. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings indicated that inhibition originated from PC apical and tuft dendrites. Multineuron whole-cell recordings from PCs and interneurons combined with morphological reconstructions revealed the mediating interneurons as Martinotti cells. Martinotti cells received facilitating synapses from PCs and formed reliable inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of neighboring PCs. We describe this feedback pathway and propose it as a central mechanism for regulation of cortical activity.},

	abstract = {Transient neocortical events with high spectral power in the 15–29Hz beta band are among the most reliable predictors of sensory perception. Prestimulus beta event rates in primary somatosensory cortex correlate with sensory suppression, most effectively 100–300ms before stimulus onset. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this perceptual association are unknown. We combined human magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurements with biophysical neural modeling to test potential cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie observed correlations between prestimulus beta events and tactile detection. Extending prior studies, we found that simulated bursts from higher-order, non-lemniscal thalamus were sufficient to drive beta event generation and to recruit slow supragranular inhibition acting on a 300ms time scale to suppress sensory information. Further analysis showed that the same beta generating mechanism can lead to facilitated perception for a brief period when beta events occur simultaneously with tactile stimulation before inhibition is recruited. These findings were supported by close agreement between model-derived predictions and empirical MEG data. The post-event suppressive mechanism explains an array of studies that associate beta with decreased processing, while the during-event faciliatory mechanism may demand a reinterpretation of the role of beta events in the context of coincident timing.},

The time resolution of the method is better than 1 ms and the spatial discrimination is, under favorable circumstances, 2-3 mm for sources in the cerebral cortex. In MEG studies, the weak 10 fT-1 pT magnetic fields produced by electric currents flowing in neurons are measured with multichannel SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) gradiometers. The sites in the cerebral cortex that are activated by a stimulus can be found from the detected magnetic-field distribution, provided that appropriate assumptions about the source render the solution of the inverse problem unique. Many interesting properties of the working human brain can be studied, including spontaneous activity and signal processing following external stimuli. For clinical purposes, determination of the locations of epileptic foci is of interest. The authors begin with a general introduction and a short discussion of the neural basis of MEG. The mathematical theory of the method is then explained in detail, followed by a thorough description of MEG instrumentation, data analysis, and practical construction of multi-SQUID devices. Finally, several MEG experiments performed in the authors' laboratory are described, covering studies of evoked responses and of spontaneous activity in both healthy and diseased brains. Many MEG studies by other groups are discussed briefly as well.},

	abstract = {A realistically shaped three-dimensional single-neuron model was constructed for each of four principal cell types in the neocortex in order to infer their contributions to magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. For each cell, the soma was stimulated and the resulting intracellular current was used to compute the current dipole Q for the whole cell or separately for the apical and basal dendrites. The magnitude of Q is proportional to the magnetic field and electrical potential far from the neuron. A train of spikes and depolarization shift in an intracellular burst discharge were seen as spikes and an envelope in Q for the layer V and layer II/III pyramidal cells. The stellate cells lacked the envelope. As expected, the pyramidal cells produced a stronger Q than the stellate cells. The spikes produced by the layer V pyramidal cells (n= 4) varied between −0.78 and 2.97 pA m with the majority of the cells showing a current toward the pia (defined as positive). The basal dendrites, however, produced considerable spike currents. The magnitude and direction of dipole moment are in agreement with the distribution of the dendrites. The spikes in Q for the layer V pyramidal cells were produced by the transient sodium conductance and potassium conductance of delayed rectifier type; the conductances distributed along the dendrites were capable of generating spike propagation, which was seen in Q as the tail of a triphasic wave lasting several milliseconds. The envelope was similar in magnitude (−0.41 to −0.90 pA m) across the four layer V pyramidal cells. The spike and envelope for the layer II/III pyramidal cell were 0.47 and −0.29 pA m, respectively; these values agreed well with empirical and theoretical estimates for guinea pig CA3 pyramidal cells. Spikes were stronger for the layer IV spiny stellate (0.27 pA m) than the layer III aspiny stellate cell (0.06 pA m) along their best orientations. The spikes may thus be stronger than has been previously thought. The Q for a population of stellate cells may be weaker than a linear sum of their individual Q values due to their variable dendritic geometry. The burst discharge by pyramidal cells may be detectable with MEG and EEG when 10 000–50 000 cells are synchronously active.},

	abstract = {Recordings of extracellular electrical, and later also magnetic, brain signals have been the dominant technique for measuring brain activity for decades. The interpretation of such signals is however nontrivial, as the measured signals result from both local and distant neuronal activity. In volume-conductor theory the extracellular potentials can be calculated from a distance-weighted sum of contributions from transmembrane currents of neurons. Given the same transmembrane currents, the contributions to the magnetic field recorded both inside and outside the brain can also be computed. This allows for the development of computational tools implementing forward models grounded in the biophysics underlying electrical and magnetic measurement modalities. LFPy (LFPy.readthedocs.io) incorporated a well-established scheme for predicting extracellular potentials of individual neurons with arbitrary levels of biological detail. It relies on NEURON (neuron.yale.edu) to compute transmembrane currents of multicompartment neurons which is then used in combination with an electrostatic forward model. Its functionality is now extended to allow for modeling of networks of multicompartment neurons with concurrent calculations of extracellular potentials and current dipole moments. The current dipole moments are then, in combination with suitable volume-conductor head models, used to compute non-invasive measures of neuronal activity, like scalp potentials (electroencephalographic recordings; EEG) and magnetic fields outside the head (magnetoencephalographic recordings; MEG). One such built-in head model is the four-sphere head model incorporating the different electric conductivities of brain, cerebrospinal fluid, skull and scalp. We demonstrate the new functionality of the software by constructing a network of biophysically detailed multicompartment neuron models from the Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration (NMC) Portal (bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal) with corresponding statistics of connections and synapses, and compute in vivo-like extracellular potentials (local field potentials, LFP; electrocorticographical signals, ECoG) and corresponding current dipole moments. From the current dipole moments we estimate corresponding EEG and MEG signals using the four-sphere head model. We also show strong scaling performance of LFPy with different numbers of message-passing interface (MPI) processes, and for different network sizes with different density of connections. The open-source software LFPy is equally suitable for execution on laptops and in parallel on high-performance computing (HPC) facilities and is publicly available on GitHub.com.},

Murakami et al. recently showed that a model based on the work of Traub et al. provides a quantitatively accurate account of the basic features of three types of empirical data (magnetic fields outside the slice, extracellular field potentials within the slice and intracellular potentials within the pyramidal neurons) elicited by stimulations of the soma and apical dendrites. This model was used in the present study to compute the net current dipole moment (Q) due to each of the different voltage- and ligand-gated channels in the cells in the presence of fast GABAA inhibition. These values of Q are proportional to the magnetic field and electrical potential far away from the slice. The intrinsic conductances were found to be more important than the synaptic conductances in determining the shape and magnitude of Q. Among the intrinsic conductances, the sodium (gNa) and delayed-rectifier potassium (gK(DR)) channels were found to produce sharp spikes. The high-threshold calcium channel (gCa) and C-type potassium channel (gK(C)) primarily determined the overall current waveforms. The roles of gCa and gK(C) were independent of small perturbations in these channel densities in the apical and basal dendrites. A combination of gNa, gK(DR), gCa, and gK(C) accounted for most of the evoked responses, except for later slow components, which were primarily due to synaptic channels.},

	abstract = {Neocortical networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons can display alpha(α)-frequency rhythms when an animal is in a resting or unfocused state. Unlike some γ- and β-frequency rhythms, experimental observations in cats have shown that these α-frequency rhythms need not synchronize over long cortical distances. Here, we develop a network model of synaptically coupled excitatory and inhibitory cells to study this asynchrony. The cells of the local circuit are modeled on the neurons found in layer V of the neocortex where α-frequency rhythms are thought to originate. Cortical distance is represented by a pair of local circuits coupled with a delay in synaptic propagation. Mathematical analysis of this model reveals that the h and T currents present in layer V pyramidal (excitatory) cells not only produce and regulate the α-frequency rhythm but also lead to the occurrence of spatial asynchrony. In particular, these inward currents cause excitation and inhibition to have nonintuitive effects in the network, with excitation delaying and inhibition advancing the firing time of cells; these reversed effects create the asynchrony. Moreover, increased excitatory to excitatory connections can lead to further desynchronization. However, the local rhythms have the property that, in the absence of excitatory to excitatory connections, if the participating cells are brought close to synchrony (for example, by common input), they will remain close to synchrony for a substantial time.},

The model consists of synaptically-coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons and supports rhythmic activity in the alpha, beta, and gamma ranges. We find that the effects of neuromodulation on ionic conductances are, by themselves, sufficient to induce transitions between synchronous gamma and beta rhythms and asynchronous alpha rhythms. Moreover, these changes are consistent with changes in behavioral state, with the rhythm transitioning from the slower alpha to the faster gamma and beta as arousal increases. We also observe that it is the same set of underlying intrinsic and network mechanisms that appear to be simultaneously responsible for both the observed transitions between the rhythm types and between their synchronization properties. Spike time response curves (STRCs) are used to study the relationship between the transitions in rhythm and the underlying biophysics.},

	abstract = {Cortical gamma oscillations (20-80 Hz) predict increases in focused attention, and failure in gamma regulation is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disease. Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with the resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200 Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast, pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations, a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude and precision of evoked responses. Our data directly support the fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis and provide the first causal evidence that distinct network activity states can be induced in vivo by cell-type-specific activation.},

	abstract = {Synchronous recruitment of fast-spiking (FS) parvalbumin (PV) interneurons generates gamma oscillations, rhythms that emerge during performance of cognitive tasks. Administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists alters gamma rhythms, and can induce cognitive as well as psychosis-like symptoms in humans. The disruption of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling specifically in FS PV interneurons is therefore hypothesized to give rise to neural network dysfunction that could underlie these symptoms. To address the connection between NMDAR activity, FS PV interneurons, gamma oscillations and behavior, we generated mice lacking NMDAR neurotransmission only in PV cells (PV-Cre/NR1f/f mice). Here, we show that mutant mice exhibit enhanced baseline cortical gamma rhythms, impaired gamma rhythm induction after optogenetic drive of PV interneurons and reduced sensitivity to the effects of NMDAR antagonists on gamma oscillations and stereotypies. Mutant mice show largely normal behaviors except for selective cognitive impairments, including deficits in habituation, working memory and associative learning. Our results provide evidence for the critical role of NMDAR in PV interneurons for expression of normal gamma rhythms and specific cognitive behaviors.},

	abstract = {Selective optogenetic drive of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons (INs) leads to enhanced local field potential (LFP) power across the traditional “gamma” frequency band (20–80 Hz; Cardin et al., 2009). In contrast, drive to regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal cells enhances power at lower frequencies, with a peak at 8 Hz. The first result is consistent with previous computational studies emphasizing the role of FS and the time constant of GABAA synaptic inhibition in gamma rhythmicity. However, the same theoretical models do not typically predict low-frequency LFP enhancement with RS drive. To develop hypotheses as to how the same network can support these contrasting behaviors, we constructed a biophysically principled network model of primary somatosensory neocortex containing FS, RS, and low-threshold spiking (LTS) INs. Cells were modeled with detailed cell anatomy and physiology, multiple dendritic compartments, and included active somatic and dendritic ionic currents. Consistent with prior studies, the model demonstrated gamma resonance during FS drive, dependent on the time constant of GABAA inhibition induced by synchronous FS activity. Lower-frequency enhancement during RS drive was replicated only on inclusion of an inhibitory LTS population, whose activation was critically dependent on RS synchrony and evoked longer-lasting inhibition. Our results predict that differential recruitment of FS and LTS inhibitory populations is essential to the observed cortical dynamics and may provide a means for amplifying the natural expression of distinct oscillations in normal cortical processing.},
