    About HNN-Core
</h1>
  HNN-core is the result of an effort to clean up and reorganize the underlying code that defines the HNN software to facilitate expansion and community engagement in HNN's use and development.

  <b><a class="hnn-violet" href="https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core">HNN-core 0.1</a></b>  is a streamlined Python package that contains all of the utility of HNN with a command line interface (CLI). A goal of HNN-core is to provide an object-oriented design that allows the computational neuroscience community to understand and contribute to development and use of the HNN software analysis toolkit. The command-line utility allows easy batch processing and integration with other Python based packages such as <b><a class="hnn-violet" href="https://mne.tools/stable/index.html">MNE-Python</a></b>.  We are in the process of integrating all of the HNN-core code into the <b><a class="hnn-violet" href="https://hnn.brown.edu/installation-instructions/">GUI version of HNN</a></b>.

Installing HNN-Core
</h1>
On Linux and Mac, it is possible to install HNN-core using a single line:
<br>
<code>$ pip install hnn_core</code>
<div style="line-height:1">
<br>
</div>
Please see the <b><a class="hnn-violet" href="https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/stable/index.html#installation">HNN-core documentation</a></b> for more detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting
<br><br>
HNN-Core can also be installed on the Neuroscience Gateway Portal (NSG). The instructions for getting started are a work in progree. See <a href="https://users.sdsc.edu/~kenneth/hnn/index.html">here</a> for the installation instructions for both HNN-Core and HNN-Core GUI on NSG.
<br><br>
<b><a class="hnn-violet" href="https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/stable/auto_examples/index.html">Examples</a></b> of use are provided for simulating commonly measured MEG/EEG signals, including event related potentials and low-frequency brain rhythms, following the <b><a class="hnn-violet" href="hnn.brown.edu/tutorials">GUI-based tutorials</a></b>.
