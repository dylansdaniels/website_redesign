<b>Job Title:</b>             Software Engineer
<br>
<b>Institution:</b>        Brown University
<br>
<b>Department:</b>     Neuroscience
<br>
<b>Commitment:</b>   Full time (37.5 hours weekly)
<br>
<b>Location:</b>            Providence, RI | Hybrid eligible
<br><br>

<b><u>Job Description</b></u>
<br>
  Applications are invited for a full-time software engineering position in the computational neuroscience lab of Dr. Stephanie Jones at Brown University.
  <br><br>
  Our group combines human electrophysiological recording, computational neural modeling, and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to study the mechanisms and meaning of brain dynamics in health and disease. We developed a new neural modeling software tool designed for researchers and clinicians to develop and test predictions on the cell and circuit level origin of human electro- and magneto-encephalography (E/MEG) data. This open-source tool is called Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN) and is distributed at <a href="https://hnn.brown.edu">https://hnn/brown.edu</a> (Neymotin et al eLife 2020). 
    <br><br>
    The hired candidate will help expand HNN’s capabilities, including software development using best-practices in open-source design and community support. The candidate will also work directly with researchers to apply HNN to specific neuroscience questions. Duties will include development of tutorials, online resources, and participation in workshops aimed at training the community in the use and applicability of HNN. The candidate will work with a diverse team of researchers at Brown, Mass General Hospital, and Yale University involved in HNN development.
    <br><br>
    Candidates should have a PhD in computer science, neuroscience, biomedical engineering, physics, and/or related field. Strong Python programming skills are required, and experience with neural modeling, particularly NEURON, is preferred. Software developers without a PhD may also be considered. Familiarity with E/MEG analysis methods and/or non-invasive brain stimulation is also beneficial. Candidates should be able to work in a dynamic, interdisciplinary, and fun work environment. Brown University is an EEO/AA employer and actively solicits applications from minorities and women. Interested candidates should send a CV and a brief description of qualifications and research interests to the Jones lab manager Dylan_S_Daniels@brown.edu.
