## Preface

Welcome to our online textbook on using Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN) to study the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms of electro- and magneto-encephalography (EEG/MEG) signals. 

This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to how HNN can be used to develop and test hypotheses about the neural sources of sensor-level EEG/MEG signals. We will cover various topics, including biophysical modeling, circuit dynamics, parameter optimization, model validation, and much more. We will demonstrate how to use HNN to simulate commonly recorded EEG/MEG signals, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and low-frequency rhythms such as alpha (7-14 Hz), beta (15-29 Hz), and gamma (30-80 Hz).

HNN is an open-source software built in Python, and it can be run through the command-line interface (CLI) or the interactive graphical user interface (GUI). Most sections of the textbook will include worflows for using both the CLI and the GUI, although some advanced features (e.g., batch simulation) are only available in the CLI. 

We assume some basic background knowledge in neuroscience and neural modeling frameworks. Our Getting Started section provides an overview of key background information needed to follow along. Additionally, references are included at the end of each section for those who wish to dive deeper the methods and underlying theory. 

To get the most out of this textbook, we recommend that you [install HNN](https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/) and follow along with the examples we provide. 

If you have any questions, please see visit our [HNN Discussion board](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core/discussions) on GitHub.

Happy modeling!
