# 3.2 Primary Electrical Currents

HNN's underlying neural model simulates the primary electrical currents in the neocortex that create EEG/MEG signals. The model simulations are based on the biophysical origins of the primary electrical currents (see [Figure 1](#figure-1)). The primary electrical currents ($J^p$) are assumed to be generated by the post-synaptic, intracellular longitudinal current flow in the long and spatially aligned dendrites of a large population of synchronous neocortical pyramidal neurons [@hamalainen_magnetoencephalography_1993], [@okada_genesis_1997]. These primary currents create volume currents ($J^v$) that propagate through the brain tissue, cerebral spinal fluid, and skull. It is the volume currents that are pick up by the EEG/MEG sensors. "Inverse solution methods" (i.e., source localization methods, which HNN does *not*8 perform) applied to the sensor data estimate the location, timing, and directionality of the primary electrical current dipole sources ($J^p$) (i.e., equivalent current dipoles) [@hamalainen_magnetoencephalography_1993].

It is well-established that the current flow in the large and spatially aligned cortical pyramidal neuron dendrites is the main generator of primary current dipoles
([@jones_local_2013], [@murakami_contributions_2006], [@murakami_contribution_2003], [@okada_genesis_1997], [@hagen_multimodal_2018]). As such, HNN simulates the averaged equivalent current dipole in a region of interest from a neocortical column model via the net intracellular electrical current flow in the pyramidal neuron dendrites multiplied by their length (see red/green arrows in [Figure 2](#figure-2)) [@neymotin_human_2020]. This calculation produces physical units of $current$ x $distance$ (nano-Ampere-meter, nAm) that are directly comparable to source-localized EEG/MEG units. A multiplicative scaling factor is applied to estimate the number of synchronous pyramidal cells contributing to a recorded signal.

In the cells of our simulated network ([Figure 2](#figure-2)), axial current flow between any two neighboring model compartments i,j is defined as $i_{axial} = (v_i - v_j) / r_{axial}$, where $v_i$, $v_j$, and $r_{axial}$ are the voltages in compartment i, j, and the resistance between the compartments, respectively. In order to convert this axial current into a dipole signal, we apply a length scaling where the axial current is scaled by the inter-compartment distance along the vertical axis. The length scaling means that for the longer apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, the contribution will be larger than from the shorter layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron apical dendrites. Note that the orientation of the dendrites relative to the vertical axis also influences the contribution to the dipole signal. For example, the horizontally-oriented oblique dendrites which do not have any vertical length component, do not contribute to the dipole signal, whereas for basal dendrites oriented at 45 degrees from the vertical axis, the scaling is $-\sqrt{2}/2$ (note the negative sign is because these dendrites are pointing downward). The contribution from all neighboring compartments within a neuron is integrated and then added to a value across the set of all pyramidal neurons. As a result of the multiplication between axial current and length, the model dipole output signal has the same units of measure as the experimental data (in units of nano-Ampere-meters) and we are then able to directly compare the two signals, as well as precisely tune model parameters to match characteristics of recorded signals [@okada_genesis_1997].
