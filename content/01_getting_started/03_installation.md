# 1.3 Installation

### Local Installation
For instructions on how to install HNN locally, please visit the [Install page of our API Documentation](https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/stable/index.html).

### Google CoLab

As an alternative to installing HNN locally, we provide Google CoLab notebooks that allow you to run HNN out of your browser, with access to your local filesystem.

- [GUI Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yyjuEBimIu_f7_0Nf3YLwUiVOO7ZrKK3?usp=sharing)
- [API Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FcNhHatsuxl-pACIFn7V6H5J4GPfZ1t8)

This is the quickest way to get up and running with HNN, though it does require a Google account. If you do not have a Google account, you can create one for free to run the notebooks. There is no charge associated with using Google CoLab.

### Using the Textbook

To follow along with the examples in the textbook, you'll need to clone or download the [hnn-data repository](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-data). The hnn-data repository includes both source-localized data used in our lab's published research as well as network configurations that have been tuned for simulating different types of signals.

You can directly [download the hnn-data folder](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-data/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Alternatively, you can clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-data.git
```
