## Introducing the Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN)

HNN is an open-source software for developing and testing hypotheses on the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms of electro- and magneto-encephalography (EEG/MEG) signals. EEG/MEG are among the most powerful technologies to non-invasively record human brain activity with millisecond resolution, and they provide reliable markers of healthy brain function and disease states. 

A major limitation of EEG/MEG is that it can be difficult to connect the macroscopic signals to the underlying neural generators. This difficulty limits the translation of EEG/MEG studies into novel principles of information processing, or into new treatment modalities for neural pathologies.

HNN provides a novel solution to this challenge by giving researchers and clinicians the ability to test and develop hypotheses on the circuit mechanism underlying their EEG/MEG data in an easy-to-use environment.
