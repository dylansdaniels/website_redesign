HNN is designed to be a user-friendly software tool for researchers and
clinicians to develop and test hypotheses on the neural origins of their
EEG/MEG data. The purpose is to bridge the "macroscale" extracranial
recordings to the underlying cellular- and circuit- level activity.\
\
**HNN's underlying neural model simulates the primary electrical
currents in the neocortex that create EEG/MEG signals. The model
simulations are based on the biophysical origins of the primary
electrical currents (see Figure)**. The primary electrical currents (JP)
are assumed to be generated by the post-synaptic, intracellular
longitudinal current flow in the long and spatially aligned dendrites of
a large population of synchronous neocortical pyramidal neurons^1,2^.
These primary currents create volume currents (JV) that propagate
through the brain tissue, cerebral spinal fluid, and skull. It is the
volume currents that are pick up by the EEG/MEG sensors. "Inverse
solution methods" (i.e., source localization methods) applied to the
sensor data estimate the location, timing, and directionality of the
primary electrical current dipole sources (Jp) (i.e., equivalent current
dipoles^1^).

  HNN simulates these primary currents from a canonical model of a layered neocortical column via the net intracellular electrical current flow in the pyramidal neuron dendrites (see schematic to the right. Further details can be found at our Under the Hood page). The units of measure that come out of the model are directly comparable to those estimated from source localization methods, namely, nano-ampere-meters (nAm).   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-under_the_hood/master/html-styling/images/3d-column-model.png)

**The HNN software enables visualization of primary electrical currents
(i.e., equivalent current dipoles) (nAm), individual cell spiking
activity, and calculation of frequency domain oscillations
(time-frequency analysis and power spectral density).** HNN is intended
for studying circuit activity from one, or (coming soon), several,
source localized regions of interest based on the local network
dynamics, and the thalamo-cortical and cortical-cortical inputs that
contribute to the local activity. HNN is not designed to simulate the
activity across the entire cortex.\
\
A template circuit that represents a generalizable, canonical cortical
column is provided. The template circuit includes a scalable number of
neurons and adjustable parameters along with simulation tools to perturb
the local network with layer- and cell-specific external drive (i.e.,
spike driven synaptic input and/or tonic applied currents). See details
in [[Under the
Hood]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}](https://hnn.brown.edu/index.php/under-the-hood/).
Tools are also provided for users to directly compare simulated
electrical sources with recorded source localized data\*. In future
developments, we plan to integrate with source localization software
(see <https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html>).\
\
***Importantly, HNN was created to be a hypothesis development and
testing tool.*** While the underlying neural model is biophysically
principled and based on generalizable features of cortical networks, and
also includes neurons with realistic physiology and morphology (see
details in [[Under the
Hood]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}](https://hnn.brown.edu/index.php/under-the-hood/)),
the model is nonetheless a reduced model of neocortical network
dynamics. ***Any conclusions made are based on the underlying model
assumptions, which are outlined in detail in our [[Under the
Hood]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}](https://hnn.brown.edu/index.php/under-the-hood/)
page. Users should become familiar with these assumptions at the start
of using HNN.*** We have found the model to be useful for generating
novel and testable hypotheses on the circuit origin of some of the most
commonly measured signals, including ERPs and low-frequency
oscillations^3-7^, which provide the basis for the tutorials. In future
developments, we will create a framework for building your own cells and
circuits into the software (<http://www.neurosimlab.com/netpyne>). [We
are open-source and encourage input and expansion from the community
(see Users Forum).\
\
[ \*If you only have sensor data, you can still benefit from our
software. The primary currents are the foundation of the sensor signal
and, as such, will have similar activity profiles.
