# About HNN-Core {#about-hnn-core .srj-gray}

HNN-core is the result of an effort to clean up and reorganize the
underlying code that defines the HNN software to facilitate expansion
and community engagement in HNN\'s use and development.

**[HNN-core
0.1](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core){.hnn-violet}** is a
streamlined Python package that contains all of the utility of HNN with
a command line interface (CLI). A goal of HNN-core is to provide an
object-oriented design that allows the computational neuroscience
community to understand and contribute to development and use of the HNN
software analysis toolkit. The command-line utility allows easy batch
processing and integration with other Python based packages such as
**[MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html){.hnn-violet}**. We
are in the process of integrating all of the HNN-core code into the
**[GUI version of
HNN](https://hnn.brown.edu/installation-instructions/){.hnn-violet}**.\

# Installing HNN-Core

On Linux and Mac, it is possible to install HNN-core using a single
line:\
`$ pip install hnn_core`

::: {style="line-height:1"}
\

Please see the **[HNN-core
documentation](https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/stable/index.html#installation){.hnn-violet}**
for more detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting\
\
HNN-Core can also be installed on the Neuroscience Gateway Portal (NSG).
The instructions for getting started are a work in progree. See
[here](https://users.sdsc.edu/~kenneth/hnn/index.html) for the
installation instructions for both HNN-Core and HNN-Core GUI on NSG.\
\
**[Examples](https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/stable/auto_examples/index.html){.hnn-violet}**
of use are provided for simulating commonly measured MEG/EEG signals,
including event related potentials and low-frequency brain rhythms,
following the **[GUI-based
tutorials](hnn.brown.edu/tutorials){.hnn-violet}**.

Here is an example of the visualizations possible with HNN-core. This is
an animation of the network activity from the **[ERP
